    "bot": "Okay, let's expand on what constitutes \"Personal Data\" as defined in our privacy policy:\n\n**Expanding on \"Personal Data is information that can be used to contact or identify you.\"**\n\nThis means any information that, either alone or when combined with other information we hold, could reasonably be used to identify, contact, or locate you.  It's broader than just your name and address.  We consider the following categories as examples of Personal Data:\n\n* **Direct Identifiers:** This includes information that explicitly identifies you, such as:\n    * **Full Name:** Your given name and surname.\n    * **Email Address:** Your unique email account.\n    * **Phone Number:** Your mobile or landline number.\n    * **Postal Address:** Your full mailing address (street address, city, state/province, postal code/ZIP code, country).\n    * **Online Identifiers:**  Your IP address, user IDs, account usernames, and other online identifiers.\n    * **Government-issued IDs:** Driver's license number, passport number, national identification number (only if collected).\n\n* **Indirect Identifiers:**  These are pieces of information that, while not directly identifying you on their own, can be combined with other data to identify you.  Examples include:\n\n    * **Location Data:**  Your GPS coordinates, IP address geolocation data (approximate location based on your IP address).\n    * **Cookies and Usage Data:**  These are small data files stored on your device when you visit our website. They track your browsing activity, including pages visited, time spent on pages, and links clicked. This information, when combined with other data, can help identify you.\n    * **Device Information:** Your device type, operating system, browser type, and other technical details.\n    * **Demographic Data:** Information like your age range, gender, and interests, if collected.  (Note:  We specify in our policy *if* and *how* we collect demographic data).\n    * **Payment Information:**  Credit card numbers, bank account details (if applicable and handled securely according to PCI DSS standards or equivalent).\n    * **Health Information:** Any information related to your physical or mental health (only if collected with your explicit consent and handled in compliance with relevant health data regulations).\n\n\n**What is *not* typically considered Personal Data (unless combined with other identifiers):**\n\n* **Aggregated Data:**  Data that has been combined from many individuals in such a way that no single person can be identified.\n* **Anonymized Data:** Data where all identifying information has been removed.\n\n\n**Important Note:** This is not an exhaustive list. The specific types of Personal Data we collect will be detailed more precisely in our full privacy policy.  Any new categories of Personal Data collected will be clearly stated and subject to your consent where required by law.  Our policy will also outline the purposes for which we collect your Personal Data and how we protect it.  You should always review the full privacy policy for the most up-to-date and complete information.\n"
